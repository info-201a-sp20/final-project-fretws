## Domain of Interest:

During the strange and uncertain times we are currently living in, our group thought it fitting to use data related to the COVID-19 outbreak and try to understand how it has impacted (directly or indirectly) people around the world. Due to the stay-at-home orders issued around the world, many people find themselves at home for much longer than usual. We are collecting data on **Energy Usage**, **Mobility Trends**, and **Death Rates**. We will unpack these data sets to analyze both the environmental impact that COVID-19 (and the following human behavior) had, and the excess deaths beyond those attributed to COVID-19. By studying these data sets, we hope to learn more about how the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted the world beyond just how many are sick or dead because of the virus.

  - [COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) provides insight on how closly the stay-at-home orders around the world are being followed. The report charts movement over time by location across different catagories like retial, recreation, or groceries and pharmacies.

## Data Sets:

### Energy and Fuel Trends
This data was discovered in a report analyzing the [decrease of petroleum/fuel](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=43455) consumption and pricing due to COVID-19. The full raw data set originates from [Today in Energy](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/). The source, today in energy, specifically looks at trends associated with energy news that is updated on a regular basis to remain relevant and accurate. Specifically providing information on the increase and decrease of fuel pricing in relation to worldwide consumption for analysis. The source is composed of 28 columns describing weekly cost per gallon by region for the regular all formulations retail pricing, and 1554 rows that consist of dates from 1994 to 2020 to express the pricing changes from the past to recent effects.

### Death Rates by State
- Death counts from Jan, 2017 to Apr. 2020:
    - From [the CDC's dataset library](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Excess-Deaths-Associated-with-COVID-19/xkkf-xrst), collected as reports from U.S. counties to the National Center for Health Statistics. It is important to note that these reports can be expected to come in one to two weeks after the deaths that they are reporting.
    - 36464 rows
    - 12 columns
    - We can use this to assess mortality rates due to the coronavirus and compare overall death rates now against death rates in years we did not have active quarantine procedures.
