Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

## Domain of Interest:

During the strange and uncertain times we are currently living in, our group thought it fitting to use data related to the COVID-19 outbreak and try to understand how it has impacted (directly or indirectly) people around the world. Due to the stay-at-home orders issued around the world, many people find themselves at home for much longer than usual. We are collecting data on *Energy Usage*, *Mobility Trends*, and *Death Rates*. We will unpack these data sets to analyze both the environmental impact that COVID-19 (and the following human behavior) had, and the excess deaths beyond those attributed to COVID-19.

## Data Sets:

### Energy Usage
*Data set not yet downloaded*



### Mobility Trends



### Death Rates
