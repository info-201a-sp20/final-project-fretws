## Domain of Interest:

During the strange and uncertain times we are currently living in, our group thought it fitting to use data related to the COVID-19 outbreak and try to understand how it has impacted (directly or indirectly) people around the world. Due to the stay-at-home orders issued around the world, many people find themselves at home for much longer than usual. We are collecting data on **Energy Usage**, **Mobility Trends**, and **Death Rates**. We will unpack these data sets to analyze both the environmental impact that COVID-19 (and the following human behavior) had, and the excess deaths beyond those attributed to COVID-19. By studying these data sets, we hope to learn more about how the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted the world beyond just how many are sick or dead because of the virus.

provides graphics depicting an analysis of shelter in place. Counties are ranked by stay home percentage and illustrated by color.

  - [COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) provides insight on how closly the stay-at-home orders around the world are being followed. The report charts movement over time by location across different catagories like retial, recreation, or groceries and pharmacies.

  - [Social Distancing Scoreborad](https://www.unacast.com/covid19/social-distancing-scoreboard) is an interactive scoreboard showing the percentage decrease in average distance traveled, non-essencial visitation, and human encounters.

  - [Global Energy Review 2020](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2020/oil#abstract) provides insight on how decreased global mobility has had a profound effect on oil demand around the world. Decreased demand will reduce the cost and use of oil after restrictions are lifted.

### Questions About This Domain
- Has the advent of big tech companies releasing data on mobility trends at all convinced people to better adhere to stay at home orders?
- 
- How does the dip in gas prices compare to previous dips in gas prices? Specifically, does the drop in demand fully account for the drop in price, or does there seem to be a more complex reason for the prices to drop as much as they have?
- Is there a correlation between how well people are sticking to the stay at home order and how many deaths are occurring in their area?

## Data Sets:

### Petroleum and Fuel Trends
- Today in Energy Data:
    - [Today in Energy data](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/) was collected based on national and worldwide petroleum/fuel pricing and consumption. These numbers are updated on a regular basis, approximately once a week, to understand the effects of issues such as COVID 19 on fuel trends.
    - 1554 rows
    - 28 columns
    - This data is helpful in comprehending the effect of COVID 19 on current petroleum usage and cost trends compared to historical ups and downs of fuel pricing.

### Mobility Trends
- Google mobility data:
    - [Google](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) released the data after removing identifying user information. The data was generated by counting the number of searches that users of Google maps completed, and it was sorted by country of origin.
    - 1158 rows
    - 112 columns
    - This is useful in analyzing a population's interest in getting out of the house, and assessing to what extent is public transit still being used.

### Death Rates by State
- Death counts from Jan, 2017 to Apr. 2020:
    - From [the CDC's dataset library](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Excess-Deaths-Associated-with-COVID-19/xkkf-xrst), collected as reports from U.S. counties to the National Center for Health Statistics. It is important to note that these reports can be expected to come in one to two weeks after the deaths that they are reporting.
    - 36464 rows
    - 12 columns
    - We can use this to assess mortality rates due to the coronavirus and compare overall death rates now against death rates in years we did not have active quarantine procedures.
