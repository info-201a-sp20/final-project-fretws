## Domain of Interest:

During the strange and uncertain times we are currently living in, our group thought it fitting to use data related to the COVID-19 outbreak and try to understand how it has impacted (directly or indirectly) people around the world. Due to the stay-at-home orders issued around the world, many people find themselves at home for much longer than usual. We are collecting data on **Energy Usage**, **Mobility Trends**, and **Death Rates**. We will unpack these data sets to analyze both the environmental impact that COVID-19 (and the following human behavior) had, and the excess deaths beyond those attributed to COVID-19. By studying these data sets, we hope to learn more about how the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted the world beyond just how many are sick or dead because of the virus.
