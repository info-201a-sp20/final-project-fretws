    ranging from January 4th to April 25, 2020. An interative chart such as
    this allows us to see not only regional differences in excess deaths,
    but also state to state deaths per region. With excess death noticeably
    increasing across the regions form February and tapering off during the
    month of April. Additoinally, the Southern states see the most number of
    excess death, reaching numbers above 800 for states such as West Virginia.")
