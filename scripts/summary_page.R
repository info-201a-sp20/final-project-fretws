     established, data was collected regarding the population's movement for a variety of activities. Those trends can be seen
     changing from February 15th to May 7th of 2020. It was important to notice the differences in mobility for each category
     on one graph, in reference to when when the initial data was released by Google and Apple. The Residential category is one
     that seems to stand out due to its high rate of mobility from the baselin comapred to other catergories. By allowing customization of categories
     and date range, we allow users to view specific information and compare information. Its important to notice that this interactive
     chart confirms our reasoning behind the analysis of the mobility dataset. "),

     across the US when assessed by region instead of state. Comparing the changing numbers across each region displays
     clearer view on how COVID regions across the US. Comparing the average mobility trends for the country ranging from
     January 4th to April 25, 2020. An interative chart such as this allows us to see not only regional differences in excess
     deaths, but also state to state deaths per region. With excess death noticeably increasing across the regions form February
     and tapering off during the month of April. Additoinally, the Southern states see the most number of excess death, reaching
     numbers above 800 for states such as West Virginia.")
