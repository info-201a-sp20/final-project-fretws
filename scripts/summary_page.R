   p("Due to COVID-19 the US has seen tremendous changes in mobility trends
      across the country. As stay-at-home orders were established, data was
      collected regarding the population's movement for a variety of
      activities. Those trends can be seen changing from February 15th to May
      7th of 2020. It was important to notice the differences in mobility for
      each category on one graph, in reference to when the initial data
      was released by Google and Apple. The Residential category is one that
      seems to stand out due to its high rate of mobility from the baseline
      compared to other catergories. By allowing customization of categories
      and date range, we allow users to view specific information and compare
      the results. Its important to notice that this interactive chart
      confirms our reasoning behind the analysis of the mobility dataset.

   p("The analysis of this data confirms our hypothesis that the average change
     in mobility by state significantly decreased following the rise of
     COVID-19. The areas with a that were highly impacted by COVID-19 saw a
     swift change in mobility habits. Other factors that could affect the
     mobility of the state is the transportation and economic standard for
     the area. Generally, the highest changes in mobility are seen just after
     the stay at home orders are put in place. However this is not true for all
     travel catagories. In many states, people residential and parks areas had
     higher mobility. Additionally, the travel to grocery and pharmacy
     locations remained fairly consistant due to them being essencial

      in at different rates from the baseline across the US when assessed by
      region instead of state. Comparing the changing numbers across each
      region displays clearer view on how COVID regions across the US.
      Comparing the average mobility trends for the country ranging from
      January 4th to April 25, 2020. An interative chart such as this allows
      us to see not only regional differences in excess deaths, but also
      state to state deaths per region. With excess death noticeably
      increasing across the regions form February and tapering off during the
      month of April. Additionally, the Southern states see the most number
      of excess death, reaching numbers above 800 for states such as West
      Virginia. Significant insight such as this confirms our reasoning behind
      the analysis of the death dataset.
